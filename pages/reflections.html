        <p>The first week of CodeCrew coding bootcamp was an introduction to coding. We covered a range of topics
            including, using the terminal, github,
            a basic Python overview, intellij and a basic JavaScript introduction. This week was full of new and
            exciting information
            about coding and the specifics of CodeCrew's program. Click to number 01 to view the fill video describing

        <p>The second week of coding bootcamp provided a more in-depth look into JavaScript. We learned the basics of
            arrays,classes and objects,
            switch case, and scope. We also began a Python introduction. Two languages in one week! Click the number 02

        <p>By the third week I had finally settled into the structure of the class and found an effective study method.
            This week we learned Python
            basics. We covered loops,string formatting,data types, and functions. Python and JavaScript built on one
            another nicely
            and this week went smoothly. Click the number 03 the view the full video describing my impression of the

        <p>The fourth week was a relatively simple introduction to HTML and CSS. We began the week with a brief review
            of Python and quickly moved into
            creating simple webpages. This was one of my favorite weeks so far. Click the number 04 to view the full

        <p>Week five brought most of the skills we have been learning so far together. We linked JavaScript files to our
            HTML files to make
            our webpages dynamic. We also learned JQuery this week. These introductions made our webpages a little more
            complex. Click the number 05

        <p>This was our first big project week. On Monday I completed two smaller simple game projects using HTML CSS
            and JQuery. Tuesday through
            Thursday was dedicated to creating a portfolio website from scratch. Check out the full video describing my

        <p>Week seven started out with a presentation of the front in project that I spoke about last week. It was
            amazing to see my fellow students' work and I really enjoyed being able to present my hard work. After
            presentations we moved into backend! Tuesday through thursday was committed to learning to basics of Django.

        <p>Week eight was a deep dive into Django. We learned template inheritance, model based forms, basic CRUD, and
            form validation. We also completed our first django mini-project this week working with the knowledge from
            Monday-Thursday of this week and all of last week along with some simple front-end design.We took a sample
            JavaScrip test as well to brush up on the language after two weeks on Pyton and to prepare us for the
            JavaScript certification. Click on the number 08 to view a pdf of the full description of the week!

        <p>Week nine we moved from focusing fully on back-end to a more full-stack approach. We continued to work with
            template inheritance and model based form accessible from out html files. We had out first group project
            this week creating a simple full stack webpage that allowed users to login, create users and
            create/read/update/delete items. This week does not have a full description.

        <p>Week ten was full of projects! On monday we did a mini project creating a full stack site similar to
            Pintrest. Users were able to login in, view all recipes, filter recipes and create recipes. This project
            was a test of our knowledge of model based form and created complex functions in our views. We also
            completed a more complex full stack project tuesday-thursday. Click the number 10 for a pdf of the full

        <p>Week eleven is my first official week as a CodeCrew Code School Student. I passed the invitation period and I
            can now confidently continue on my journey to being a full stack dev! This week we started with
            presentations of our full stack website from last week. We also moved into a new full stack system: MERN.

        <p>This week we wrapped up our introduction to the backend components of MERN. We also started React on Friday!
            We also had a guest speaker,Ted Patterson, on Wednesday to talk about UX/UI design. And finally I started
            some updates to this portfolio using a new propgram. Click to number 12 for a fun video of the full

        <p>This was a React heavy week after being introduced to the JavaScript library on Friday of last week. We built
            several small projects to gte comfortable with using components to their full potential using state and
            properties. On Friday we began to combine the full MERN stack by bringing together our two weeks of backend
            with our week of frontend. Click the 13 to download my full description of the week!

        <p>This week was focused on the complexities of react forms. We learned the importance of state driven
            components
            and how to integrate the front and backend seamlessly. We also touched on postmon to test server side post
            requests. We also worked on creating an impressive and compelling resume. Click the number 14 to view the

        <p>This week was a crash course in user authentication and cookies in MERN. This was the hardest week by far.
            but we were able to utilize the front in forms with backend strategies to verify users and save their login
            information. We also had the opportunity to mix and mingle with professionals in the memphis tech community.

        <p>This was a project week. We completed our first full stack MERN project which ran from thursday or last week
            to thursday or this week. The project was to create a Mock Twitter. This was a very difficult project for
            our skill level but the end product was very rewarding. You van view the project <a href="case_studies/twitter_project.html">here</a> and
