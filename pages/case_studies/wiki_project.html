        <p>This was my first full stack project. The Mock Wikipedia Project was a week long solo project to recreate
            Wikipedia using a django database with python and the django html templating language for interface. The
            Mock Wikipeda project put a culmination of three months of Coding Bootcamp into practice.</p>

        <p>Django's templating languages allows for consistency between pages. Templates extend a base page and pull in
            blocks for repetitive sections such as a header and footer then altering the body based on page specific
            content. I utilized this functionality to create a coherent and simple design whether the user is logged in
            or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site also supports search capabilities by filtering the django model based on user input into the search
            bar. This is one of my favorite things about the site. Although search capabilities are simple and standard
            the instructors of the boot camp encouraged us to figure out how it works on our own instead of giving a
            lesson on the topic. Discovering and implementing something that I interact with daily was extremely
            rewarding.

                As mentioned above the Mock Wikipedia Site utilizes a django database. This allows users to log in or
                for new clients to create a profile. When a new client visits the site they are able to see all posts
                and search posts. Once logged in a user has the ability to create, edit, or delete their post in
                addition to base site functionality to view all and search.

                The Mock Wikipedia Site was my first in-depth usage of CRUD in a django project. Logged in users are
                able to edit their posts from a profile page that lists ony their posts or when they view the details of
                a post that they created. Users simply click an edit or delete button to update or delete a post. They
                can also add additional information to a post with a 'add related content' button that renders a form
                similar to the create post form.

                When a user clicks on a post from the home page they are directed to a details page that lists the full
